# React Hook Form demo

A simple demo of the React Hook Form.

Used @hookform/devtools in order to visualize the form elements and its properties.

Using of react hook form helps you to avoid multiple re-renders while using controlled form elements(which happens in React). To visualize it, we are showing renderCount on home page.

Pls follow commits to notice the code changes for each adding feature

As part of this application, we will see that

1. How can we manage form data
2. Submit form data
3. Enforce validations and provide visual feedback
